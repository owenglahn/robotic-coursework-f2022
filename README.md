## Description
This repository is a collection of ROS packages I built for the course COMP 514: Applied Robotics, at McGill University. All of the source code is written in C++ and the simulations were done in Gazebo. Most of these packages are designed to control a seven-jointed arm (gen3), while some are for a four-wheeled vehicle (husky).
